I recently got a new job which I will start in November ðŸŽ‰. I'll be working for [Timescale](https://www.timescale.com), a remote-first company. As a result of being employed as a remote worker, I was suddenly confronted with a bunch of questions which I needed to answer. This blog post attempts to provide some answers to them.

To set the scene, and give you some context: I'm not Swiss, I'm a South African with a British passport who's been living in Switzerland for ~14 years now. My life is here, my friends are here, and I recently bought an apartment. I'm not planning on leaving anytime soon. I am also not (yet) a Swiss citizen, I have a permanent residence permit (_C-Ausweis_). This also means that I am not confronted with some of the concerns that those from outside of the EU, or on a B permit would be confronted with.

> Note: I will be using a number of "common" acronyms. As I am most familiar with them in German, I will stick to using the German acronyms and will not translate them to English (e.g. I will use __AHV__ and not __OASI__). At first use, I will provide both the acronym, the full term in German, and an approximate translation to English.

In general I am concerned about:

- not doing anything wrong (sounds kind of silly, but with international tax and labour law it would be nice to get it right)
- ensuring that I am properly set up for retirement (when I eventually get there)
- saving on costs/taxes where I can
- not being screwed

I am going to address all of these points from two general points of view: employment, and social security/retirement. There is a lot of meat to each of these topics, but before we get to them I don't think that I can continue without first giving a brief introduction to Swiss social security.

> Note: I frequenly mention the word "salary" throughout this article. In general I mean the gross annual salary, i.e. the amount of cash you earn every year (usually this is the amount which is written in the contract, but if you receive a bonus then this would usually not be in the contract, but would be included in my definition of gross annual salary).

## A primer on Swiss social security

There are a lot of articles that go into depth on this, so I'm going to try to stick to introducing the most important components. If you already know everything that there is to know about Swiss social security, skip this whole section.

Switzerland's social security system is built on a three-pillar model (3 SÃ¤ulen System). The first pillar is the government pension, the second is occupational pension, and the third is private pension.

### First pillar (government pension)

The government pension is usually called _AHV/IV_ (Alters- und Hinterlassungsversicherung / Invalidenversicherung, in English: Old-age and Survivors Insurance / Disability insurance), but it's mostly just called AHV. You have a 13-digit AHV number which is frequently used as an identifier with insurances etc. Every employed person in Switzerland is required to pay AHV on an annual basis. The amount paid in is a percentage of your annual salary. Every person receives a fixed amount annually when they reach retirement age, currently this is 28'680 CHF per year.

The contributions are split approximately 1:1 between the employee and the employer (to be precise, AHV and ALV (Arbeitslosenversicherung, in English: unemployment insurance) are paid 1:1, but FAK (Familienausgleichskasse, in English: family compensation fund) contributions are paid solely by the employer). There is a convenient [calculator](https://www.ahv-iv.ch/de/Sozialversicherungen/Alters-und-Hinterlassenenversicherung-AHV/Online-Rechner/Arbeitgebende-Arbeitnehmende) which you can use to determine how much AHV you will need to pay depending on the canton you live in, and your annual salary.

Worth mentioning is that the administration of AHV is carried out by cantonal "Ausgleichskassen" (compensation offices), [here](https://www.ahv-iv.ch/en/Contacts/Cantonal-compensation-offices) is a list of all of the compensation offices. Your employer will have registered you with the cantonal Ausgleichskasse when you started working there. Should you have any questions about AHV/IV, they are quite helpful and competent.

> Note: the employer contribution to AHV is "invisible" to the employee. You won't see it on your pay slip (only your own employee contribution).

### Second pillar (occupational pension)

The occupational pension is usually called _BVG_ (BVG is the "short name" of the law _Bundesgesetz Ã¼ber die berufliche Alters-, Hinterlassenen-und Invalidenvorsorge_. I will refrain from translating...). This is what most people know as being their "pension". The pension fund (Pensionskasse) and available pension plans are chosen by the employer.

The basic idea is that the employer and employee both pay equal contributions to the pension fund on a monthly basis. These contributions are saved on an individual basis, but invested collectively and cover both retirement, and death or disability (in German: Vorsorge und Risiko). When you reach retirement age, you can choose whether to withdraw the saved funds, or whether to have a monthly pension. In the case of your death the pension fund will pay a pension for your partner and any children you may have. In the case of invalidity, the pension fund will pay a disability pension until your death.

There are a _lot_ of details, such as: How much of my salary is covered? What is the interest rate on the pension fund assets? How is the monthly pension calculated? I am going to end here for now, but I have a lot more to say on this topic.

> Note: again, the employer's contribution is not visible on the pay slip, it _is_ visible however in your Vorsorgeausweis, which you should receive on an annual basis.

<!--
There is a lot of variablility in how exactly the pension plan can structured, so I won't go into too much detail yet. The gist of it is that there are a couple of "important" numbers:

- minimum BVG salary (currently 21'510 CHF)
- coordination deduction (currently 25'095 CHF)
- maximum BVG salary (currently 86'040 CHF)
- employer / employee split (usually 1:1)

The minimum basically says that if you're earning less than 21'510 CHF per year, you don't pay into BVG. The coordination deduction amount is deducted from your gross salary to determine the "insured" salary. The idea is to align the second pillar with the first pillar, basically saying that once you reach retirement you will already have ~25'095 CHF in salary from AHV. And the maximum BVG salary poses an upper limit on the "insured" salary (there are extensions, known as _Ãœberobligatorium_ in English "over obligatory").

So to give some examples: if you're earning 80kCHF per year, your "insured" salary will be 80kCHF - 25'095 CHF = 54'905 CHF. If you're earning 100kCHF per year, your "insured" salary will be 86'040 - 25'095 CHF = 60'945 CHF.

Finally comes the employer:employee split. This can be determined (by the employer), but it must be at least 1:1. Some employers choose to do a 2:1 (employer : employee) split.

### Third pillar (private pension)

The third pillar is basically whatever each individual saves for their retirement. Swiss law splits this into two components (for tax ~~dodging~~ _ahem_ deductions, why else?): 3a and 3b.

Most people would have heard of pillar 3a at some point because any contributions are tax-deductible. As an employed person who is paying into a pension fund, you can deposit 6'883 CHF into pillar 3a annually. If you're not paying into a pension fund you can deposit as much as 34'416 CHF per year. The catch: 3a funds cannot be withdrawn until you reach retirement age (there are exceptions, such as buying a house, starting your own company, or emigrating).

Pillar 3b is usually never referred to as "3b" (except by insurances who are trying to ply their wares).

### Plugging holes

There are a few "gaps" in the three-pillar system which are filled by obligatory and voluntary insurances. The primary reason for these gaps existing is that the wheels of beurocracy are slow: the state disability insurance will only begin to pay after you have been disabled for more than a year, and your pension fund's disability insurance will only kick in after between one and two years. This means that there is a period of up to two years in which you are both unable to work, and not receiving any income.

The first gap-filler is the obligatory accident insurance _UVG_ (again, a "short name" for a law: _Bundesgesetz Ã¼ber die Unfallversicherung_). If you are employed by a Swiss employer, they are paying this. It comes into play should you have an accident (independent of whether the accident took place at work or not) and be unable to work, and covers: payment of 80% of your salary, any medical costs, as well as a one-off payment to your spouse or children in the case of your death. UVG is not reflected on your pay slip as it is paid directly by the employer.

The next is a voluntary sick pay insurance _KTG_ (Krankentaggelder, in English: sick pay). Structurally it's similar to UVG, but covers sickness, and not accidents. Most employers will take out KTG for all of their employees and pay equal contributions, so you will see your employee contribution on your pay slip.

## Salary

If you're in the process of interviewing or negotiating your offer, probably one of the main concerns you will have is salary. Before you can adequately go into a salary negitation, it's important to understand exactly how you will be employed, as that will make a big difference on what salary you should ask for.

### Employment forms

You will have to ask your future employer which employment form they would prefer, as they are the ones who will determine how they want to employ you. The company's domicile plays a big role here as well, as we shall see. These are the options that I know of, but I am not familiar with how they all work:

- Directly employed

  You would be on the company's direct payroll, and they would be responsible for paying whatever social securities are necessary in their country of domicile.
  As far as I can tell this is the most complicated and least flexible option. I'm not even sure to what extent it's possible. If you know more about how this works, please let me know! 

- Employed through payroll company

  Some companies may already work with a global payroll company such as [Remote](https://www.remote.com), in which case you become an employee of the payroll company. Presumably the payroll company has a presence in Switzerland and covers all social security.
  
- Employed by company as contractor

  You have a contracting relationship with the company. From the point of view of the company, you are not an employee. There is a lot of administrative stuff to think about (which we will get to later), but for now the most important thing to know is that as a contractor you must pay all social security and pension benefits out of your own pocket.

Each of these employment forms will play a role in the type of conversation you should have with your future employer. I'm going to skip "directly employed" because I don't understand it well enough. I assume that being employed through a payroll company will be similar to being employed by any other Swiss company, but it would be worthwhile to clarify how the expenses for the payroll company are covered. Generally, I would assume that the contractually agreed-upon salary will exclude employer social security contributions. If you're going to be employed as a contractor then you need to be aware that you will need to pay all employer contributions out of the gross "contracting" salary yourself. Additionally, you need to validate how the company handles vacation and sick leave, as these are things which.

### Calculating employer's social security contribution

I'm going to use the term "all-in" salary to refer to the gross annual salary _plus_ the employer contributions. If you want to maintain the same salary as you currently have working for a Swiss company, this is the number that you need to ask for from the new company.

Let's take the example of Lisa, currently earning 100kCHF gross annual salary, working for a company in ZÃ¼rich.

We would like to calculate how much the employer pays for the following contributions: AHV, KTG, UVG, BVG.

For AHV, the employer's contribution in the canton of ZÃ¼rich is 7.6% of gross income. A typical UVG and KTG may cost approximately 1% and 0.8% respectively of gross income, but KTG is split 1:1 between employer and employee. BVG is a little complicated, so let's make some assumptions: Lisa is under the age of 35, doesn't have supplementary cover (Ãœberobligatorium), and has a 1:1 split. This defines her insured salary as 60'945 CHF. The pension contribution is 7% (this is defined by law and dependent on age), let's assume 1.5% for risk (I'm not sure how this is defined, but it's in the ballpark). With the 1:1 split, we come to 4.25% for BVG.

> Note: The numbers for BVG are basically the most conservative that they could possibly be at this salary. The 7% figure goes up with age, Lisa could have supplementary insurance, and her employer may have a 2:1 contribution.

| Purpose | Employer % | Applied to  | Final Contribution |
|---------|------------|------------:|-------------------:|
| AHV     | 7.6%       | 100'000 CHF | 7'600 CHF          |
| UVG     | 1.0%       | 100'000 CHF | 1'100 CHF          |
| KTG     | 0.4%       | 100'000 CHF |   400 CHF          |
| BVG     | 4.25%      |  60'945 CHF | 2'590 CHF          |

All in all Lisa's employer contributes 11'590 CHF every year. This means that should she want to work as a contractor and have equivalent take-home pay, she needs to ask for a salary of 111'600 CHF.

## Being employed as a contractor

Usually one would equate being a contractor with being self-employed. Not according to Swiss law. In order to become self-employed you need to submit a registration to the local AHV Ausgleichskasse. As part of the registration you have to prove that you are working for three or more different companies (this can differ from canton to canton, but the [SVA ZÃ¼rich](https://svazurich.ch/) said that they require three). If you cannot do so, then you are classified as _"ScheinselbstÃ¤ndig"_ (falseley self-employed).

In the eyes of the state, if you have one employer, but that employer is not domiciled in Switzerland, then you are an _ANobAG_ (Arbeitnehmende ohne beitragspflichtigen Arbeitgeber - you can't make this up! - in English: employee without an employer having immediate social insurance obligations).

#### ANobAG

Being ANobAG is somewhat similar to being self-employed. You are required to register with the AHV Ausgleichskasse, and pay both employer and employee social security contributions. You are required to take out an UVG insurance. If your employer is an EU/EFTA state, then you _must_ have a second pillar pension. There are a number of pension funds which offer pensions to ANobAGs. If your employer is in a non-EU/EFTA state, then you can _choose_ whether you would like to have a second pillar pension or not. _But_, there is only one pension fund which accepts non EU/EFTA ANobAGs: the [Stiftung Auffangeinrichtung](https://web.aeis.ch/). The Stiftung Auffangeinrichtung has kind of a bad reputation for being slow, expensive, and not providing a competetive offering. We will look into this more in a bit.

Should you choose not to have a second pillar pension, you immediately become eligible for the "large" pillar 3a, allowing you to deposit up to 20% of your annual income (minus social security deductions) up to a maximum of 34'416 CHF.

If you are taxed at the source (Quellensteuerpflichtig) then according to [this](https://cmt.ch/quellensteuer-und-anobag/) as ANobAG you are no longer required to be taxed at the source. I would clarify the details with the local tax authorities though.
